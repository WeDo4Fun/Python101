# -----------------------------------
# Common Variable Declaration Formats
# -----------------------------------

# try to be consistent in your code whcih convention you use
# the most broadly used convention are 
# for declaring variables or naming function use style_snake_case 
# for declarign a name of CLASS we use StylePascalCase

styleCamelCase = "variableName"
StylePascalCase = "VariableName"    # declaring CLASS
style_snake_case = "variable_name"  # standard variabe or naming function
STYLEUPPERCASE = "VARIABLENAME"     # this is used as a CONSTANT
_supper_secret = "_variable_name"   # PRIVATE variable
styleWithNumber1 = "variableName4"
style_with_number_2 = "variable_name_3"

print(styleCamelCase)
print(StylePascalCase)
print(style_snake_case)
print(STYLEUPPERCASE)
print(_supper_secret)
print(styleWithNumber1)
print(style_with_number_2)
